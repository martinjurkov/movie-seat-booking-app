# Movie Seat Booking App

## Intro

Hello, there! 🙋🏽‍♂️

I would like to introduce you to my Movie Seat Booking App.

## Overview

For this challenge, I used...

 - JavaScript (ES6) (to build out the site)
 - SCSS/SASS preprocessor (to style it)
 - localStorage (to keep user's data)

## Challenge
Users should be able to:

 -by clicking on the title or picture see details about specific movie and movie trailer
 -by clicking on booking button be able to choose movie and seats by user's choice
